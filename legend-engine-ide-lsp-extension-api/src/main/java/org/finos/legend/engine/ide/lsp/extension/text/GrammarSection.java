 * <p>A section of a text document in a particular grammar. This is a continuous interval of lines, possibly starting
 * with a grammar declaration line of the form "{@code ###GrammarName}". A grammar declaration line indicates the start
 * of a new section, so it will occur only as the first line of a section. Sections after the first in a document must
 * begin with an explicit grammar declaration line. The first section may optionally begin with an explicit grammar
 * declaration line. If an explicit one is not present, the section is deemed to have an implicit grammar declaration
 * line equivalent to {@code ###Pure}.</p>
 * <br>
 * <p>A grammar section begins at the beginning of its first line and ends at the end of its final line, either with a
 * line break or the end of the text document. Sections contain only complete lines; no section will contain a partial
 * line.</p>
